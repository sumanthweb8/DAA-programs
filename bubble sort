procedure bubbleSort( list : array of items )

   loop = list.count;
   
   for i = 0 to loop-1 do:
      swapped = false
		
      for j = 0 to loop-1 do:
      
         /* compare the adjacent elements */   
         if list[j] > list[j+1] then
            /* swap them */
            swap( list[j], list[j+1] )		 
            swapped = true
         end if
         
      end for
      
      /*if no number was swapped that means 
      array is sorted now, break the loop.*/
      
      if(not swapped) then
         break
      end if
      
   end for
   
end procedure return list
The recursive relation for the bubble sort algorithm can be defined as follows:

T(n) = T(n-1) + O(n)
